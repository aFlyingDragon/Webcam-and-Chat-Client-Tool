# Webcam-and-Chat-Client-Tool
**OS:** Windows 10
**Python Version:** 3.10.0
### Program Info:
This program activates user webcam on program execution and allows a user to open a chat dialog box that will auto-adjust to the side of the main window if the main window is moved. Chat dialog is not retained between instances of the program, but is an easy implementation on top of the existing code.
### Known Bugs:
> The chatbox will open multiple times if the button is clicked more than once
